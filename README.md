pointerchallengeleague.com
--------------------------

A website I've made for my very first own personal client.
Uses nicegui python framework and can be deployed into a container.

### Pre-Reqs:

* You need a python virtual environment that has nicegui installed.

That's pretty much it lol.

### To run locally:
```sh
# clone down this repo and go into dir
git clone https://github.com/Lynnsanity/pointer-challenge-league && cd pointer-challenge-league
# start the environment
python3 -m pip venv env && source env/bin/activate
# install nicegui
pip install nicegui
# to run locally:
python3 main.py
```
A browser window should open http://localhost:8080 showing PCL website.

### Make a Docker/Podman Build

* TODO
